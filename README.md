## Commit message convention

All the commits should follow conventional commit format. [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/ONN2wfwV/2bb6be32afeeaccf77bc1cc04a93ccf5/github-repositories-explorer) which I used to track progress and generate a commit messages.

### Format

The commit message should be structured as follows:
```
story/story-number: Subject
```

If there's no related JIRA story: 
```
tech/optional-scope: Subject
```

If there's related JIRA bug:
```
bug/story-number: Subject
```

### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Capitalize the subject line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Don't use dot (.) at the end

A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:

If applied, this commit will **your subject line here**
For example:

* If applied, this commit will **refactor subsystem X for readability**
* If applied, this commit will **update getting started documentation**
* If applied, this commit will **remove deprecated methods**
* If applied, this commit will **release version 1.0.0**
* If applied, this commit will **merge pull request #123 from user/branch**

Notice how this doesnâ€™t work for the other non-imperative forms:

* If applied, this commit will ~~fixed bug with Y~~
* If applied, this commit will ~~changing behavior of X~~
* If applied, this commit will ~~more fixes for broken stuff~~
* If applied, this commit will ~~sweet new API methods~~

## Available Scripts

### `yarn test:coverage`

Launches the test runner in the interactive mode to see actual test coverage by each file.<br>
At this stage, the coverage for all files is more than 90%.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
